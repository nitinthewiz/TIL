AirServer, the app that allows users to Airplay on a variety of hardware, has made their own [hardware](https://www.airserver.com/Connect). it supports 4K UHD 60 FPS, Airplay, Google Cast, and Miracast. So it's a pretty extensive solution!

It's pretty interesting, but expensive, at $500. It's clearly meant for enterprise, instead of home users. Perhaps they'd do good to release a consumer hardware at about $75? (Apple TV is $150)

Perhaps it's available cheaper second hand? I'll have to look!
